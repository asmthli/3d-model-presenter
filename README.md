# 3D Model Presenter

Makes sharing interactive 3D models in the browser easy. A user should be able to view a model by using a shared link.

The idea of the project stems from being able to easily share animated 3D models with family members as a gift.

## Existing solutions

There are existing solutions for viewing 3D models online. I have created this as a way to practice my React and React Three Fiber skills.

A quick survey of existing solutions leads me to believe something of this nature is not widely popular however. Most solutions seem to be quite heavy with features and may be too much for the purpose intended here.

## Technologies used

-   React
-   React Three Fiber

## Future improvements

I will likely expand this to allow for users to easily upload models and set up a simple presentation. The idea would then be to create a unique shareable link for the presentation.
